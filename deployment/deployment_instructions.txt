REFERENCE GUIDE: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress

1. Run the deployment. This will build the container and deploy it to the Cluster 
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
2. Run the service creation (Service represent a group of commonly labelled objects e.g. nodes and pods).
    kubectl apply -f service.yaml
3. Run the ingress creation, this sets up a Loadbalancer that distributes traffic to the service 
    kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml  

  
For the ingress to work you need to have a static IP and a certificate (I created a certificate on DNSimple and uplodaed the keys).
